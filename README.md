A race minigame. A group of players takes part in races, with each race arena being a predefined area with a start and finish for each player. All competing players start at the same time and the fastest three are recorded for each run, with 3, 2 and 1 point being awarded respectively. The players accumulate their score and finally the point leaderboard is used to determine the winner.
